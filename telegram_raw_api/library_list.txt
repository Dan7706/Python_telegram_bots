There are different ways to interact with telegram bot using their API.
First way and obviuosly the hardest is using CURL (Client URL).
    for sending messages:   curl -X POST  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"chat_id": "CHAT_ID", "text": "YOUR_MESSAGE"}' \
     "https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/sendMessage"
    (where -X specifies http which in the end is transformed to https,
        -H indicates HTTP headers for the request,
        -d '{"key": "value"}' specifies the JSON payload for the request.)


    for getting updates:  curl "https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/getUpdates"

This method is the hardest but possible for many basic operations.

There is an easier way to interact with telegram bot api using aiohttp and asyncio 
modules/frameworks and it makes our lives easier. more examples I provide in raw_api_code.py
file in the directory.

The raw api is lying on the basics of modern frameworks: such as TelegramBotAPI, aiogram, 
pyrogram telethon and etc...
Some of them for interaction use only token provided from telegram botfather, meanwhile 
the other are using hash within the token.
